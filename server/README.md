# DOCKER IS UP BOI

Docker is made working on it yay!
so now easy easy just:
1. Have docker installed
2. go into the server dircectory where when you `ls` or `dir`  you can see `docker-compose.yml` on your main file
3. run `docker compose up` and everything should be running!
4. you can test it by going into web browser and calling `http://127.0.0.1:5000/orders` and it should return you a `[]`.
5. Happy Coding!
